So that's what happened. Eckhardt wanted to destroy the order, so he attacked when they were not prepared. The entire monastery is badly damaged, skeletons of monks are scattered everywhere. Some of them were raised by Eckhardt to kill everything that moves. I put them all to rest while exploring these ruined walls, yet found nothing of any importance to me. Most books from the library were burnt to ashes, only several tomes about alchemy have survived.

The most interesting thing left in the monastery was the sword. It seems it belonged to the first abbott of the monastery. He was also one of the first Lux Veritatis members. I took it with me as a souvenir. It will look good in my trophy room, next to the Chirugai.
