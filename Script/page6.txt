A monastery? Here? And no one knew about it even though we worked near it for several months? There are mountains around the building complex, it's well hidden. Normally I would wonder why they chose such a secluded place, but I'm so tired I don't want to think about it. I hope they are friendly enough to help me. I really don't want to go back to the mines, to that man.
Strange. For a moment I thought I could hear screams coming from beneath the ground.
