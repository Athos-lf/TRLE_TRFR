Opening mines was a good idea. This way I can further investigate the area around the monastery without raising suspicions. Lux Veritatis whelps don't even know what's going on down here and when the time comes, I will hunt them down and let them taste the agony I had endured in the pit. Once they are gone, nothing will stop me from getting the Obscura Paintings.
