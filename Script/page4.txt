Another shaft collapsed! We tried to rescue miners but the boss told us to leave them. When someone told him they may still be alive he hit him and told them to get back to work. How he can be so cruel? 
The boss has finally stopped wandering aimlessly around. He found a way to use the lift without three plugs, so they're not needed anymore. As far as I know it's a rough job and nobody knows how long it will work, but the boss is pleased anyway.
More miners have vanished. Strangely enough, someone has seen turkish trucks in the area of the mine. What are turks doing here?
