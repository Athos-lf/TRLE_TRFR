So there were more of them!
I thought the only hiding place of the Lux Veritatis was Castle Kriegler. It seems though I was wrong - and one more shrine of this mysterious Templars' offspring is hidden somewhere in Germany. Unfortunately, Eckhardt already found it's location. Even though he's dead now, he could have already desecrated that place and stolen all secrets it once contained. Still, there's nothing left for me to do in Prague and I need to bounce back from that experience in Paris.
And Egypt.
Poor Werner, I will miss him.

It seems there's an excavation site run by the Cabal at the border between Germany and the Czech Republic. I will travel there immediately. Hopefully there's still something left to explore.
