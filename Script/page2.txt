What a fool! His stupid behavior will backfire on us all if he won't stop repeating the same mistakes. He calls himself a technician but it's the second time pumps have got stuck and won't work. It wouldn't be so bad if that was the only problem, but it seems the technician had also something to do with the dissappearance of the third plug used to power up the second lift. The boss is furious and when he's angry he gets really creepy. The technician had a conversation with him and the second time I saw him he looked as if he was going to have a mental breakdown any minute.
That reminds me. It was about two days ago that I saw him last time. I wonder what happened to him?
