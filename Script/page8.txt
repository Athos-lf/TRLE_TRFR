He's here! The monastery is burning, I can hear screams above me. They have hidden me here, they told me he won't get here even if he wanted. It seems they are fighting. I can hear swords, gunfire and these strange, inhuman screams.

(This part seems to be written much later.)

The screams have stopped. Apart from the sounds of burning flames I can't hear anything but silence. Is the battle over? When are they going to get me out of here? The gate is locked, I have to wait.

(A note written at the end of the page, seems to be the last.)

They won't come. I am trapped.
